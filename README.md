# Larables

### About

Larables is a laravel package that allows you to seemlessly generate html tables entirely using PHP classes.

### Installation

Install with composer `composer require jennosgroup/larables`.

### Setup

Publish the package assets with artisan command `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=larables-assets`.

Then you include the `larables.js` script in your html markup.

`<script src="{{ asset('vendor/larables/js/larables.js') }}" defer></script>`

The `larables.js` must be included in your html markup if you need the built in functionality of bulk request including checkboxes selection, per page option, search function and sorting columns.

If you are going to create numerous html tables across different pages of your site that will share similar styles and features, it is best to create an abstract class and let all your other tables extend it. This is because all configuration for the look and feel of the table is class based.

### Getting Started

Create your class and extend the `Larables\Table` class.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Tables;

use App\Models\Post;
use Larables\Table;

class PostsTable extends Table
{

}
```

Then in your controller, create an instance of the table by calling the static `make` method and passing it to your view. In your view file, include the `larables::larables` partial view, which is already setup to render your table based on your class definitions. It's that simple! The `laratables::larables` partial view requires the table instance to be passed in a variable named `$table`.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

class PostController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Render the view for the posts listing.
     *
     * @return Illuminate\View\View
     */
    public function index()
    {
        $table = PostsTable::make();
        return view('posts.index', compact('table'));
    }
}
```

And in your view file...

```html
@extends('layouts.app')

@section('title', 'All Posts')

@section('content')
    @include(Larables::viewsId().'::larables')
@endsection
```
